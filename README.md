## ABout the MENTIApp
This is the part of the MENTI project that replicates an web app that was coded with CSS and Java/JavaFx. It has three main applications; a sleep tracker that calculates the amount of sleep they got (time they got up - time they went to sleep). The second component is a to do list that keeps a track of the activities they did on a daily basis and finally, a seperate GUI that allows the user to have some time to themselves to meditate and hopefully relieve their stress.

## Why use MENTIApp
The app can be seen as a habitual tracker as it allows them to use the to-do list to list their activities that they have to do everyday, and once they check each one off, it gives them a sense of satsifaction. It allows them to also have a general understanding of their well being, such as the amount of hours of sleep they are getting. Finally, it can be used as a meditation space for them to lower their cortosol levels.
